'''
A Python package for the traversal and transformation of Tensorflow computations graphs.

Main focus of this package is on the transformation to other data formats and programming
languages. One goal is to visualize and understand the computation graph better. Another
goal is to reach new platforms like JavaScript with Tensorflow.
